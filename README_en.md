## 🎬 Sora Introduction

Sora is OpenAI's revolutionary AI video generation model, representing a paradigm shift from "AI painting tools" to "AI creative partners." It no longer passively executes commands but deeply understands video context, lighting, physics, and creative intent.

- 🎯 **Context-Aware Generation**: Truly understands the relationship between characters and environments, creating coherent video scenes
- 🔧 **Precise Control**: Adds or replaces video elements with extreme precision, perfectly handling occlusion relationships and lighting effects
- 🌐 **Deep 3D Understanding**: Can "see" 3D structures in 2D prompts, enabling true spatially-aware creation
- 🎬 **Style Consistency**: Builds "visual worlds" with completely unified styles based on text descriptions
- ✨ **Remix - Collaborative Creation**: Through the Remix feature, viewers can directly interact with creators, evolving from "master-servant dialogue" to "inspiration communication" between creators

## 💡 Prompting Tips

### Basic Prompt Structure

A basic qualified Sora prompt usually contains the following elements:

1. **Visual Style** - Specify the visual style of the video (such as cinematic style, animation style, etc.)
2. **Scene Description** - Clearly define the main scenes and environments in the video
3. **Subject Actions** - Describe the actions and behaviors of the main subjects
4. **Camera Movement** - Describe camera movement, angles, and composition

### Advanced Prompting Techniques

An excellent personalized Sora prompt also considers the following elements:
1. **Scene Transitions** - Consider the relationships between multiple scenes and design smooth scene transitions
2. **Emotional Atmosphere** - Depict the overall atmosphere of the environment and emotional characteristics of characters
3. **Detail Enhancement** - Emphasize important details in the prompt
4. **Lighting Changes** - Define the overall lighting relationships
