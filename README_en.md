## 🎬 About Sora

Sora is a revolutionary AI video generation model developed by OpenAI, representing a paradigm shift from "AI painting tool" to "AI creative partner." It no longer passively executes instructions but deeply understands video context, lighting, physical logic, and creative intent.

- 🎯 **Context-Aware Generation**: Truly grasps the relationship between characters and environments to create coherent video scenes.
- 🔧 **Precise Control**: Adds or replaces video elements with extreme accuracy, perfectly handling occlusions and lighting effects.
- 🌐 **Advanced 3D Understanding**: "Sees" the 3D structure in 2D prompts to enable spatial-aware creation.
- 🎬 **Style Consistency**: Builds a "visual world" with fully unified style based on text descriptions.
- ✨ **Remix - Collaborative Creation**: Through the Remix feature, viewers can directly interact with creators, evolving from a "command-and-execute" dynamic to "inspiration exchange" between creators.

## 💡 Prompting Tips

### Basic Prompt Structure

A qualified basic Sora prompt typically includes the following elements:

1. **Visual Style** - Specify the video’s visual style (e.g., cinematic, animated).
2. **Scene Description** - Clearly define the main scene and environment in the video.
3. **Subject Action** - Describe the actions and behaviors of the main subject.
4. **Camera Movement** - Detail camera movement, angle, and composition.

### Advanced Prompting Techniques

An excellent, personalized Sora prompt also considers these additional elements:
1. **Scene Transitions**: Plan the relationship between multiple scenes and design smooth transitions.
2. **Emotional Atmosphere**: Depict the overall mood of the environment and the emotions of characters.
3. **Detail Enhancement**: Highlight key details in the prompt.
4. **Lighting Changes**: Define the overall lighting relationships.
